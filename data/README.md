## Data

The data consists of daily snapshots of COVID-19 positive test counts as reported on the [coronavirus dashboard](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk). The snapshots are from October to December 2020 and stored as timestamped csv files. The files come from an archive maintained [here](https://github.com/theosanderson/covid_uk_data_timestamped).

Recently the dashboard API has added an `archive` endpoint which could be used to obtain the history of reports stored here.
